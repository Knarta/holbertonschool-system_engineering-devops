# Secured and Monitored Web Infrastructure Design

## Component Explanations

### 1. Firewalls
- **Purpose**: Network security systems that monitor and control incoming and outgoing traffic
- **Benefits**:
  - Prevents unauthorized access
  - Protects against DDoS attacks
  - Controls traffic flow
  - Implements security policies
- **Implementation**:
  - One firewall at load balancer level
  - One firewall per web server
  - Rules based on IP addresses, ports, and protocols

### 2. SSL Certificate
- **Purpose**: Enables HTTPS for secure data transmission
- **Benefits**:
  - Encrypts data in transit
  - Provides authentication
  - Ensures data integrity
  - Builds user trust
- **Implementation**:
  - SSL certificate installed on load balancer
  - HTTPS traffic termination at load balancer
  - Internal communication can be HTTP

### 3. Monitoring Clients
- **Purpose**: Collect and transmit system metrics and logs
- **Benefits**:
  - Real-time system monitoring
  - Performance tracking
  - Issue detection
  - Capacity planning
- **Implementation**:
  - One monitoring client per server
  - Collects:
    - System metrics (CPU, memory, disk)
    - Application metrics
    - Database metrics
    - Network metrics
    - Log files

## Infrastructure Issues

### 1. SSL Termination at Load Balancer
- **Issues**:
  - Traffic between load balancer and servers is unencrypted
  - Potential security vulnerability in internal network
  - Man-in-the-middle attacks possible
- **Solution**:
  - Implement end-to-end encryption
  - Use SSL passthrough
  - Implement internal network security

### 2. Single MySQL Write Server
- **Issues**:
  - Single point of failure for write operations
  - Limited write scalability
  - Potential data loss if primary fails
- **Solution**:
  - Implement multiple primary nodes
  - Use database clustering
  - Implement automatic failover

### 3. Monolithic Server Components
- **Issues**:
  - Resource contention
  - Difficult to scale individual components
  - Complex maintenance
  - Single point of failure for multiple services
- **Solution**:
  - Separate components into different servers
  - Implement microservices architecture
  - Use containerization
  - Implement service discovery

## Monitoring Web Server QPS

### Steps to Monitor QPS:
1. **Configure Monitoring Client**:
   - Install monitoring agent
   - Configure log collection
   - Set up metrics collection

2. **Set Up Metrics**:
   - Track HTTP request counts
   - Monitor response times
   - Track error rates
   - Monitor server resources

3. **Create Dashboards**:
   - Real-time QPS visualization
   - Historical trends
   - Alert thresholds
   - Performance baselines

4. **Configure Alerts**:
   - Set QPS thresholds
   - Configure notification channels
   - Define escalation policies

## Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Security**:
   - Implement end-to-end encryption
   - Add WAF (Web Application Firewall)
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Add DDoS protection

2. **High Availability**:
   - Implement database clustering
   - Add redundant load balancers
   - Implement automatic failover
   - Add geographic redundancy

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Implement APM (Application Performance Monitoring)
   - Add synthetic monitoring
   - Implement log aggregation
   - Set up automated alerting
