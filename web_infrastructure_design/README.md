## 🏗️ Simple Web Infrastructure

The diagram `0-simple_web_infrastructure.png` represents a basic web infrastructure with a single server.

### 🔧 Components
- **Single server** hosting:
  - 🖥️ Web server (Nginx)
  - ⚙️ Application server
  - 💾 Database (MySQL)
- 🌐 DNS server
- 🔄 HTTP/HTTPS communication

### ⚠️ Limitations
- ❌ Single point of failure (SPOF)
- ⏱️ Downtime during maintenance
- 📈 No scaling capability for high traffic

---

## 🔄 Distributed Web Infrastructure

The diagram `1-distributed_web_infrastructure.png` shows a more robust infrastructure with load balancing.

### 🔧 Components
- ⚖️ Load balancer (HAProxy)
- 🖥️ Multiple web servers (Nginx)
- ⚙️ Application servers
- 💾 Primary-Replica database setup
- 📁 Centralized application files

### ✨ Advantages
- ✅ Better availability
- 📊 Load distribution
- 🔄 Database replication

---

## 🔒 Secured and Monitored Web Infrastructure

The diagram `2-secured_and_monitored_web_infrastructure.png` presents an infrastructure with security and monitoring.

### 🔧 Components
- 🛡️ Multi-level firewalls
- 🔐 SSL certificate
- 📊 Monitoring clients
- ⚖️ Secure load balancer
- 🖥️ Secure web and application servers

### 🚀 Features
- 📈 Real-time monitoring
- 🔒 Enhanced security
- 🛡️ Attack protection
- 📊 Metrics collection
